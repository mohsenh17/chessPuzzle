# Chess Puzzle Solver

## Overview

Chess Puzzle Solver is a Python-based application designed to provide an interactive chess puzzle-solving experience. The implementation is divided into three main phases

## Phases

### 1) Image to Board

In the initial stage, the application analyzes an image of a chessboard, extracting details about the current piece positions. This image-to-board conversion serves as the basis for upcoming puzzle-solving phases. While the current emphasis is on processing chessboard images in the traditional newspaper chess format (using basic algorithms), there's potential for future expansion. This may involve incorporating more advanced techniques, such as image recognition and computer vision with a training dataset and a deep learning model, to handle diverse chessboard formats.

### 2) Puzzle Solving

The second phase challenges users to find the checkmate by strategically moving chess pieces. Players interact with the digital chessboard, making moves to navigate through various scenarios. The puzzle-solving phase employs chess algorithms to evaluate moves, identify checkmate conditions, and provide feedback to users. This interactive and dynamic aspect aims to enhance chess skills while keeping users entertained.

### 3) User Interface (UI)

The third phase focuses on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface to enhance the overall user experience. The exact medium for the UI is yet to be determined, as the application aims to be versatile and accessible across different platforms. Possibilities include a web-based interface, a standalone desktop application, or even a mobile app, depending on user preferences and usability considerations.
